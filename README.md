# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

#### Louise is fundraising her play “Fever”. In order to get an idea of her fundraising goals, we have taken a look at a large data set of campaigns and their successes. We have analyzed this information to get an idea of how successful plays have been in the past.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I preformed the analysis for this challenge by dissecting the Kickstarter data set. We first took a look at the number of successful, failed and canceled theater campaigns by month by creating a pivot table and line graph from that pivot table. See below for the line chart showing this information. We can see that every month there were the most successful campaigns which is good news for Louise.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second way I dissected the data set was by creating a chart with the number of successful, failed and canceled plays by goal amount. To visualize this information, I created the line chart shown below. We can see that the percent of successful plays varies depending on the total goal amount. We did see higher percentages of success rate in campaigns $15000 or less, so Louise should think about having a smaller campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There could be a few challenges to overcome with this project. A challenge with creating pivot tables is making sure you have the information in the correct fields. Pivot tables can create different outcomes if the fields are in the columns vs rows so understanding how you want to see the data is important. Another challenge with this project is making sure you have the correct syntax and information when making formulas. It is very easy to write a formula incorrectly and pull the wrong information, especially with nested formulas like we used in the Outcomes based on Goals chat. 

## Results

####- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

It doesn’t matter what time of year; more theater campaigns were successful every month than those that failed. There were a lot more successful campaigns in the summer months, May through July. This data also shows us that very few theater campaigns get cancelled. 

####- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

No play campaigns were canceled no matter the fundraising goal, but the percent of successful campaigns varied. Those campaigns with lower fundraising goals have a higher percentage of being successful. 

####- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are very few plays with large fundraising goals. This could skew the analysis because the sample is so small. 

####- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other graphs we could create could analyze the following: Length of campaign, average donation per backer and percentage pledged vs goal.
